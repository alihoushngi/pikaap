# 🚖 Pikaap Fleet Management Panel

**Pikaap** is a transportation and taxi fleet service company based in **Mazandaran, Iran**.  
This dashboard project was one of my **first professional React applications**, designed to provide a complete admin interface for managing drivers, trips, vehicles, and real-time tracking.

I was responsible for converting custom design specifications into a dynamic and responsive single-page dashboard using **React** and modern frontend libraries.
